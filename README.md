Events(The EventPage component is designed to manage events, allowing users to view, create, update, and delete events. It is built using React and Axios to interact with a backend API.

useState and useEffect hooks to manage event data,
Upon loading the page, useEffect calls the backend API to retrieve events,

The createEvent function sends a POST request to the API,

When an event is created or updated, handleSubmit processes the form, 

The handleDelete allows admins to remove events.
